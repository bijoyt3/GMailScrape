# GMailScrape
Created a database of GRE questions scraped from daily Kaplan Test Prep emails

Halfway through studying for the GRE, I ran into an issue many people have faced before: I ran out of free offical ETS test prep materials. Not one to try third party test materials, I scoured the internet for more math and verbal questions. At my wits' end, I realized that wait, I have a treasure trove of questions sitting in my GMail inbox. It came out to be around 300 or so unique questions which was more practice materials than I had before and thus began the process of extracting the pertinent data from the emails and storing them in an Excel file as a respository of vetted, high-quality test questions. 

The Process:

Step 1: Export Emails

Step 2: Extract Question, Answer, and Image data 

Step 3: Store them in Excel
